# 📸 Image Aesthetic Blueprint
## (Global Photography Style Guide)

This document defines the visual identity for all photography used on the website.

Any image added to the project should visually conform to these rules so that it
automatically matches the site’s dark, technical aesthetic without manual editing.

---

## 1. Purpose

Ensure that all images:

- Feel cohesive with a **dark, technical UI**
- Look **intentional and professional**
- Require **no per-image manual editing**
- Instantly match the site’s aesthetic when dropped in

---

## 2. Aspect Ratio & Framing Rules

### Primary Ratios
- **Preferred:** 16:9 (landscape)
- **Alternative:** 3:2 (landscape)

### Usage

**Grid / Thumbnail View**
- Crop to **4:3**
- Maintains a clean and uniform grid layout

**Lightbox / Expanded View**
- Use full **16:9 or 3:2**
- Designed for immersive, wide presentation

### Composition Guidance
- Favor **wide compositions** with strong depth
- Leave visual breathing room for overlays or typography
- Avoid tightly cropped or claustrophobic framing

---

## 3. Resolution & Quality Standards

### Minimum Requirements
- **Minimum:** 1200 × 800 px
- **Recommended:** 1920 × 1080 px or higher

### Display Rationale
Images must remain sharp on:
- Large desktop monitors
- High-DPI / Retina displays
- Full-width lightbox views

---

## 4. Color & Tonal Aesthetic

### Overall Mood
- Dark
- Cinematic
- Technical
- Controlled, not flashy

### Color Temperature
- Slightly **cool bias** (blue / cyan leaning)
- Avoid warm yellow or orange dominance

### Contrast
- Medium-to-high contrast
- Deep blacks preferred over gray shadows
- No washed-out highlights

### Saturation
- Natural but restrained
- Colors should pop against dark UI without overpowering it
- Avoid neon or overly vibrant tones

### Accent Colors

If an image has a bright focal point (like a light, a sign, or a piece of tech), leaning that highlight toward Cyan/Teal/Blue will instantly harmonize the image with the website's primary UI color.

## 5. Shadow & Depth Treatment

### Black Levels
- Shadows should feel intentional and deep
- Avoid flat or lifeless midtones

### Vignette Expectation
- Subtle darkening toward edges
- Focuses attention toward the center
- Helps blend image edges into dark backgrounds

---

## 6. Subject Matter Guidelines

### Works Best
- Landscapes with strong sense of scale
- Urban scenes with leading lines
- Lone figures in wide environments
- Travel, exploration, or documentary-style shots

### Avoid
- Overly staged or stock-photo compositions
- Busy frames with no clear focal point
- Bright, airy, lifestyle-style photography

---

## 7. Interaction & Motion Expectations

### Hover / Focus Behavior
- Subtle sense of depth or presence
- Micro-interactions should feel smooth and deliberate
- Never abrupt, playful, or distracting

### Visual Priority
- Images should feel like **windows**, not decorations
- UI overlays must complement, not dominate

---

## 8. Performance & Format Rules

### File Format
- **Preferred:** WebP
- **Fallback:** JPEG

### File Size
- Target **≤ 500 KB per image**
- Balance sharpness with fast load performance
