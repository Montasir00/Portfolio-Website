# Echo_Search

This project is a front-end clone of Google’s Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search pages. The goal is to replicate the functionality of Google’s search interface, including redirecting users to Google search results based on their query. This project is part of the CS50 Web Programming course.

## Features

- **Echo Search Page**: Users can input a search query and be redirected to the Google search results page.
- **Echo Image Search Page**: Users can input a query and be redirected to Google’s image search results.
- **Echo Advanced Search Page**: Users can refine their search with multiple filters and be redirected to Google’s advanced search results.

## Pages

1. **Echo Search (index.html)**: A simple search bar that submits the query to `https://www.google.com/search`.
2. **Echo Image Search (image.html)**: A form that submits search queries to `https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch`.
3. **Echo Advanced Search (advanced.html)**: A form with filters for advanced search options, redirecting users to Google’s advanced search results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file:

   ```bash

   https://github.com/Montasir00/Echo_Search.git
   
Open the index.html, image.html, or advanced.html in your browser to view the pages locally.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type a search term in the input field and click **Search** to be redirected to the Google search results.
3. Alternatively, visit the **Echo Image Search** or **Echo Advanced Search** pages to perform specialized searches.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the pages.
- **CSS**: Styling the pages to resemble Google’s interface.
- **Forms**: Used to collect and send search data to Google via GET parameters.
