That's a great question! Since you're looking to personalize the "Interests" page with your own photography, here are the technical dimensions and stylistic suggestions to make them look perfectly integrated with the site's design.
1. Recommended Dimensions
The lightbox uses a split-screen layout on desktop, so the images need to be high-resolution to look sharp.
Aspect Ratio: Aim for 16:9 or 3:2 (Landscape). The current placeholders use 1200x800, which is a classic 3:2 ratio.
Resolution:
Minimum: 1200 x 800 pixels.
Recommended: 1920 x 1080 pixels. This ensures that even on large monitors or high-density (Retina) displays, your photos look crisp.
File Format: Use WebP if possible (for fast loading) or JPEG (saved at 80% quality). Keep file sizes under 500KB to ensure the "pop-out" effect remains snappy.
2. Visual Style & Editing Suggestions
To make your photos "vibe" with the dark, technical aesthetic of the website, consider these editing tweaks:
Color Temperature: Lean slightly towards the cooler side (blue/cyan tints). This matches the primary accent colors of your site.
Contrast & Black Levels: Since the site has a deep navy/black background, slightly deepening the shadows in your photos will make them feel like they belong in that space. Avoid "washed out" or overly bright, airy edits.
Saturation: Keep saturation natural but controlled. You want the colors to pop against the dark UI, but "neon" or over-saturated colors might clash with the professional tone.
Vignetting: A very subtle dark vignette around the edges of the photo can help draw the eye toward the center of the image and blend the edges into the dark lightbox frame.
Subject Matter: Since this is a "Travel Journal," photos with a strong sense of scale (like a lone person against a mountain or a wide city street) work beautifully with the large typography in the lightbox.
3. Pro Tip for Integration
When you're ready to add them, make sure the "Main" thumbnail (the one in the grid) and the "Wide" image (the one in the pop-up) are the same photo but cropped differently.
Grid Thumbnail: Crop to 4:3 to keep the grid looking uniform.
Lightbox Image: Use the full 16:9 or 3:2 version to fill the explorer view.
